There are 4 scripts :
- TXTCODv4.7.1-text.pl: textual encoding script: launch it by typing "perl TXTCODv4.7.1-text.pl"
- TXTCODv4.7.1-tk.pl : GUI encoding script : launch it with a "perl TXTCODv4.7.1-tk.pl"
- the TXTCODv4.7.1-cgi.cgi/TXTCODv4.7.1-cgi.gz couple : These are the CGI scripts. To open the interface open the TXTCODv4.7.1-cgi.cgi in your navigator.

The utilisation of the scripts is simple. I put you a part of the TXTCOD documentation concerning Algorithm writing.

   Writing an algorithm is simple : create a file ended by ".alc". This file will contain one-line commands who will tell the module the way to encode and decode your files.
1) encoding
  The first part of the file will contain the encoding algorithm.
  This algorithm will have a few variables :
      - X, each encoded letter
      - A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H,I,J, script-defined variables.
      - T,M,P  more secured variables
   There are many operators :
      - addition: "+"
      - subtraction: "-"
      - multiplication: "*"
      - division: "/"
      - power: "**"
   For example, we'll use the line : "X*(A+2)" in order to multiply the variable by (A+2). The compilation will be done internally by the module
		
2) decoding
   After the encoding part of the file, we will put a line containing only the word "end" without any blank or invisible character. After this word there is the decoding part. The variables of this part are the same thn in the first part. 
   For example, if in the first part you put "X*(M+2)" you will type in the second part "X/(M+2)" in order to make the X variable becoming what she were before the encoding
   The root is done by this operation : for a "X**A" in the first part you will put "X**(1/A)" in the second.
		
3) comments
   You can comment your algorithm by any line beginning with a sharp #.
4) Notes
   You should not do operations who will make mubers (initial numbers up to 255) becoming too small or too big : perl will round the final numbers and the decoded letter will be very approximative.
